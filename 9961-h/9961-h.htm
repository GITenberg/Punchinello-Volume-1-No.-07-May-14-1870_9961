        <small>"The great value of this book to American readers
        will be found In the fact that it is not merely a useful
        and trustworthy guide in matters of fashionable etiquette,
        but also in those make up the daily round of social and
        domestic life. The subject is treated with a large
        liberality of view that takes in many of the practical
        questions arising in every grade of society, in regard to
        dress, food, exercise, daily habits of the mind and body,
        etc. The book is divided into three parts, and treats, 1st.
        of the Care of the Person; 2d, of Manners; 3d, of Etiquette
        and Ceremonials. Under each head Is given a large amount of
        information upon points often unconsciously disregarded by
        Americans. The author<br>
        tells exactly what people want to know in respect to giving
        breakfasts and dinners, giving and receiving calls, evening
        parties, visits of ceremony, addressing notes, letters,
        invitations, etc., and meets an acknowledged want in a very
        practical as well as entertaining manner."<br></small><br>

          and pathos are closely allied in sound as well as in
          sense. Mr. FECHTER evidently regards them as completely
          identical; and in his acting, as in his pronunciation,
          uniformly prefers the former to the latter. He has
          recently exemplified this by his personation of CLAUDE
          MELNOTTE, in that most tawdry specimen of the
          cotton-velvet drama, the LADY OF LYONS. This melancholy
          event took place a few nights since at the French
          Theatre, that mausoleum of the illegitimate French drama.
          Miss CARLOTTA LECLERCQ, an actress who deserves the
          highest praise, and who would receive it were it not that
          a doubt as to the proper pronunciation of her name
          prevents the bashful critic from mentioning her when
          flushed with the generous enthusiasm of beer, played
          PAULINE, and a number of Uncertain People played the
          dickens with the rest of the <i>dramatis
          person&aelig;</i>. Every one knows the play, and no one
          cares to hear how the Uncertain People mangled it. The
          audience naturally took no interest in it until the third
          scene of the first act was reached, and shouts of "Long
          live CLAUDE MELNOTTE" were heard from behind the scenes.
          After which everybody remarked, "Now he's coming," and
          rubbed their lorgnettes with looks of expectation and
          corners of pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>

          <p><i>Enter</i> CLAUDE. "Gif me choy, dear mutter, I've
          won the brize."</p>

          <p><i>Mother</i>. "Humph! What's the wally of it, my
          boy?"</p>

          <p>CLAUDE. "Every thing. It is wealth&mdash;the 'ope of
          vame&mdash;the ambition to pe worthier of PAULINE. Ah! I lofe

          <p>One of these voices was the soft, silvery and modest
          voice of MATADOR, who went out, and sitting upon a
          convenient hydrant, (not one of the infamous cast-iron
          abortions with an unpleasant knob on the cover,)
          contemplated the midnight stars, and seriously meditated
          upon Mr. FECHTER. And in spite of a previous unhesitating
          belief in Mr. DICKENS' critical judgment, and in spite of
          a desire to find in Mr. FECHTER the greatest actor of the
          age, he could not perceive in what respect that
          distinguished gentleman deserves his world-wide
          reputation. Is his manner natural? Is his elocution even
          tolerably good? Is his pronunciation of English words any
          thing but barely intelligible? To these questions a
          mental echo answered with a melancholy negative. And when
          the occupant of the meditative hydrant demanded to know
          what single merit could be found in Mr. FECHTER'S acting,
          his only answer was a suggestion from a prosaic policeman
          that he cease to put idiotic questions to the unoffending
          lamp-post.</p>

          <p>There are those&mdash;and enough of them to fill any
          theatre&mdash;who sincerely admire Mr. FECHTER; but it is
          impossible to resist the conviction that their admiration
          is only a dutiful acquiescence in the judgment of Mr.
          DICKENS. With the utmost desire to do no injustice to a
          genial gentleman, who conscientiously strives to carry
          out his theories of what acting should be, the
          undersigned is forced to confess that Mr. FECHTER in an
          English play is a spectacle so hopelessly and earnestly
          absurd, as to call for commiseration rather than for the
          laughter which it would deserve were it professedly a
          burlesque entertainment.</p>

          <p>PHILADELPHIA, April 12.</p>

          <p>Dear PUNCHINELLO: A few days since I received a card
          of invitation for <img src="images/4a.jpg" align="left"
          alt=""> admission to a private view of a very fine
          collection of pictures, by European and American artists.
          I visited the galleries, accompanied by an amateur friend
          who has a fine artistic education, having travelled some
          six months on the Continent. Being engaged in the
          picture-auction business, I am not altogether a tyro in
          art, and determined to send you a few notes taken on the
          spot, the combined effort of amateur friend and myself.
          The walk to the gallery, extending over a half-hour in
          time, was taken up by my amateur friend aforesaid, with
          an endeavor to give me some general ideas, more than
          initiative, with reference to art matters. For instance,
          he said the public liked glitter and varnish in a
          picture, but it does not follow on that account that the
          picture is good. He then mentioned the
          "Mimmin&eacute;e-Pimmin&eacute;e" style, and the
          "Pre-Raffaelite" style, and the Rar&eacute;e shows of
          art, and I had the whole subject so jumbled up that my
          artistic ideas became quite confused. He made a
          quotation, giving me to understand that it was not
          original; it ran as follows: "Indifferent pictures, like
          dull people, must be absolutely moral." I am not
          sufficiently informed to quite comprehend this selection
          from another man, but as we were at the time about
          entering the galleries, I remained quietly
          ignorant.</p><img src="images/4b.jpg" align="right" alt=
          "">

          <p>The first picture that attracted our admiration was a
          "Sheep scene," by Lambdin. Every particular hair on the
          old ram is well made out. The frame on the picture is
          beautifully embossed, with a rich velvet border of
          sea-green mandarin pattern.</p>

          <p>The next picture worthy of notice is a "Street in
          Venice," by Canal-etti&mdash;a singular specimen of this
          artist's first manner. The figure at the crossing is
          rendered with great feeling. It is needless to mention
          that the street is covered with water, which is
          beautifully clear and transparent, showing the depth of
          mud and slime during the dry season. The frame is
          ornamented with flowers in relief, and gilt in the very
          best manner.</p><img src="images/4c.jpg" align="left"
          alt="">

          <p>"A Musical Party," by Bass-ano, is very highly
          finished, especially the party, who have evidently been
          inhaling stimulants. This picture is painted on a gold
          ground, and is considered a rare specimen of Italian art.
          It was formerly in the Campo-Santo-di-Pisa
          collection.</p>

          <p>The frame is the blue-lotus pattern, very curiously
          gilt and chased. <img src="images/4d.jpg" align="right"
          alt=""> This style of frame would sell without
          difficulty.</p>

          <p>The picture called the "Star of the East," by WEST,
          has a scolloped frame in the Tuscan style, with extra
          fine enamelling. This is a very singular picture. It must
          be admitted that this frame is finished with great
          care.</p>

          <p>There is a frame made from a curious kind of wood, on
          a picture by CONSTABLE, entitled the "Midnight Arrest."
          The picture is certainly a matchless gem, very low in
          tone. The mosaic border to the frame is quite unique in
          its design.</p>

          <p>Among the works by American artists, we notice some
          remarkably fine productions. The picture by a lady
          amateur, entitled, "The Toilet of a <img src=
          "images/4e.jpg" align="left" alt=""> Girl of the Period,"
          demonstrates the progress our artists are making in genre
          painting. The subject is rendered with great purity of
          feeling, and the smelling-bottle in the foreground adds
          greatly to the spirit of the composition. The frame is
          highly ornamented with scarce Japan gold, elaborately
          chased in a superior manner.</p>

          <p>There is a picture by Miss T&mdash;&mdash;n, called the
          "Blonde's Revenge," that evinces talent of a superior
          order. This picture has been noticed by various New-York
          and Western journals, but I do not consider with any
          degree of justice to its surpassing merits. The color is
          equal to a beautifully polished Pompeiian brass
          door-plate; the drawing is immense, though truth must
          compel us to say that the costumes are rather slighted.
          The principal figure of the group, which is taken from a
          French model, seems to stand right out from the canvas;
          this I consider a very high point of excellence. Visitors
          should be cautioned against approaching this picture.</p>

          <p>I regret that time will not permit me to give you any
          further notice of this collection, but I will endeavor to
          get my amateur friend to go often and obtain notes for
          me. Unless I accompany him, however, I fear he will not
          pay sufficient attention to the frames.</p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">No. II.</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> OH, FATHER, what funny things are caused by
          the revolution of a planet!</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Well, revolutions are not always such funny
          things, as those wretched creatures on the earth up there
          must have found out by this time.</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> How dry you are, pa! I didn't mean the
          revolutions on a planet, but the revolutions of a
          planet.</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Well, a distinction, I admit. But what are
          you driving at?</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> Several things. For instance, seven
          revolutions of the planet Earth produce a new number of
          PUNCHINELLO&mdash;a funny thing, as you often say
          yourself.</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Well put, truly.</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> And seven revolutions also give rise to the
          Revolution itself, which (being a woman all Right in head
          and heart) I regard as about the funniest thing
          going.</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> "Funny," child? Why, I never saw any thing
          less so. It is dreadfully serious. It is even sanguinary;
          sadder still, abusive and vulgar. What is there comical
          about coarseness?</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> You don't take my idea, father. It is funny,
          because it assumes so much. It does not realize that
          womanly modesty is the great obstacle to its success, and
          that if it was as well endowed with that quality as the
          average of American women, it would promptly cease to
          revolve.</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Why, HELENE! what has set you off? Where did
          you pick up this nonsense? What can you possibly know of
          Women's Rights, as I believe they call the new
          Movement?</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> Why shouldn't I know something about it,
          when it has been in your mouth for months? And ain't I a
          woman? Besides, don't we women know some things by
          instinct?</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Well, well, child! I wish you could know
          Astronomy by instinct; for I begin to see I've a job
          before me, if only to keep you to the point.</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> The Compass-point, do you mean, father?</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> No; the Study-point. Do you call this
          studying Astronomy?</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> I think, pa, I like the practical part
          best.</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Ah, that which allows you to study the
          Fashions in Broadway! Well, woman is woman, I believe,
          the Universe over! But, come; a short lesson, to begin
          with. Here is a fine view of Saturn, with his Rings.</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> "Rings?" Are they anything like the New-York
          Rings you have read about?</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> Well, yes; no, not exactly; but a Ring
          within a Ring, is a phrase that applies to both subjects,
          just now.</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> Oh, pshaw! I thought you meant finger-rings!
          What does Saturn want of Rings?</p>

          <p><i>F.</i> And what does New-York want of 'em. They are
          there, and there they'll stay!</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> But I mean, what does a gentleman want of
          rings?</p>

          <p>F. Don't we find, every where, that the most
          Saturnine, the dullest, and stupidest, and lowest, are
          generally the fondest of this sort of ornament?</p>

          <p><i>D.</i> Oh, dear! Father, how you do try me! (Do see
          him, gazing away, when he knows I'm dying to get a
          squint! He pays me no more attention than though I was a

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">WHAT I KNOW ABOUT FREE
          TRADE.</p>

          <p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO: In a paper of such great influence
          as PUNCHINELLO, vast subjects should be set before the
          community. I know of none vaster than Free Trade. You
          see, every body understands that subject and nobody can
          explain it. I propose, therefore, to turn the light of my
          penny dip upon it, and to set forth, in concise language,
          what I know about free trade.</p>

          <p>It must be premised that there is a great deal to be
          said on the other side, and that nothing can be more
          abominable than free trade to a protectionist, unless it
          be protection to a free trader. Free trade is&mdash;well&mdash;free
          trade is&mdash;well&mdash;let me illustrate: cigars made out of
          cabbages are not nice; not to put too fine a point upon
          it, they're nasty. We are greater at raising cabbages
          than we are at sprouting cigar tobacco. Under these
          circumstances the free trader (he's a smoker, or if he
          isn't, his aunt or sister is) says we want Havana cigars
          to enter our lips without the taint of revenue. That's
          free trade.</p>

          <p>Every youth is a free trader. Don't you remember your
          own youthful follies? If you are of the male persuasion,
          would you have traded your jack-knife for TOM SMITH'S
          bull-pup, if there had been a tariff on the pup. Or, if
          you are of the feminine persuasibility, would you have
          swapped your crying-doll for BETSY JONSES' ring-tailed
          cat, if the cat had been compelled to crawl through the
          custom-house and pay duties? Besides, don't you remember
          how often your mother deprived you of a second cup of
          tea, on the plea that it would injure your health? Much
          as I respect your mamma, I can not refrain from informing
          you that that plea was false, and that it was the absence
          of free trade that deprived you of a second cup of China
          whiskey. Then you know that the lump-sugar, the raisins,
          the cake, etc., were always locked up in a pantry. All
          the result, my dear sir, of an absence of free trade.</p>

          <p>Now that you have grown up, the result is the same.
          You must have your soup, and (I do not mean to be
          pathetic) what is soup without salt? You must travel on
          the cars, but what are cars without rails? But, alas,
          salt and rails are in the black list. What do you care,
          whether or not TOM JONES and BILLY BROWN make money out
          of their salt and iron mines? You want cheap soup and
          cheap riding. Then every time that you pay one hundred
          dollars for your wife's dry-goods, you have the ecstatic
          pleasure of knowing that you are paying fifty dollars
          because Mr. JOHN ROBINSON can't make goods as cheap as
          the English manufacturers.</p>

          <p>In the natural state, man is a free trader. When our
          good Christian brethren give an Indian a string of beads
          for a buffalo-skin, the Indian charges no custom duties.
          He don't want to keep beads out of his country. When LOT
          swapped his wife away for a pillar of salt, the trade was
          free. When the Americans traded away good ships and
          cargoes for Alabama claims, not a word was said about the
          tariff. These, however, are cases in which nature rather
          gets ahead of civilization.</p>

          <p>See the result of the lack of free trade in our
          country. The brick manufacturers must be protected, so a
          heavy tariff was placed on the foreign article. Our brick
          men, finding that they had a soft thing, tried to solve
          that conundrum which the Israelites gave up: "How do you
          make bricks without straw?" They made a patent brick,
          built the Howard Museum in Washington, (was it a museum
          or a college?) the thing tumbled down, and a
          Congressional committee sat among its ruins. Poor Gen.
          HOWARD is in a muddle, and wishes, from the bottom of his
          heart, that we had free trade in bricks.</p>

          <p>Then, morally, see the high position of the free
          trader. Poor men who must have tea or cigars or English
          or French manufactures, are never driven to smuggling,
          where free trade prevails. The free trader would even
          abolish the tariff of two dollars and a half, imposed on
          human chattels who land at Castle Garden.</p>

          <p>That's all I know about free trade. I thought I knew
          more. I'm afraid I haven't illuminated the subject;
          however, I will turn my lantern next week on
          protection.</p>

          CORRESPONDENCE.</p>

          <p>(BY ATLANTIC CABLE.)</p>

          <p>Your representative's little speech at the great
          PUNCHINELLO dinner may be better imagined than described.
          A few words, however, may give you its <i>animus</i>.</p>

          <p>"If," said I, "in this illustrious company, one may
          indulge in a Wellerism"&mdash;</p>

          <p>"Spell it with a we, sir, if you please," whispered
          SAMIVEL, who stood right behind me.</p>

          <p>I resumed. "I have to say, that my feelings at this
          hour are too many for me. Perhaps I might add, that the
          courses have been so also. As my friend SOYER used to
          observe when we were together in the Crimea, astronomical
          and gastronomical laws are alike fixed. And one of them
          is, that the precession of the dinner-plates, and the
          nutation of the glasses, do not promote the music of the
          spheres. But, Mr. PUNCH and gentlemen, although not one
          of the heavenly bodies, indeed altogether terrestrial,
          one feels, naturally, rounder in his orbit, and a little
          more likely to see stars, after such a dinner as this,
          than before. Do I not, indeed, see around me now, all the
          stars of the intellectual firmament? Are not SIRIUS and
          ARCTURUS here, in their glory, as well as ORION and the
          rest? As my old friend CRISPIN would say, their name is
          legion! I would blaze, gentlemen, too, if possible, in
          honor of the occasion; but, as I can't Comet, meteors
          fall in lamentation of my poor ability.</p>

          <p>"The day we celebrate is truly a great one. Since the
          time of OLAF, the Northman, our Anglo-Saxon-Celtic race
          has loved its jesting philosophers. No fools are they, in
          fact, even when to that name they 'stoop to conquer.'</p>

          </div>

          <p>"The sundry contemplation of my travels, in which my
          often rumination wraps me, is a most humorous
          sadness.</p>

          <p>"But, gentlemen, your walls have, if not ears,
          tongues, to recall the glorious humor and wit of our
          race. HOGARTH looks down upon us. ADDISON tells us of
          dear old Sir ROGER de COVERLEY; I am sure he must have
          been the grandfather of Mr. PICKWICK. STERNE makes us
          weep on one side and smile on the other, at the mention
          of my UNCLE TOBY; GOLDSMITH, at the remembrance of
          himself. And so does TOM HOOD, the prince of humorists.
          THACKERAY we all remember; and neither he nor his Vanity
          Fair will ever be forgotten. DOUGLAS JERROLD, and JOHN
          LEECH, too&mdash;the only tears they ever made men shed were
          at their graves. And who can fail to feel like a
          "pendulum betwixt a smile and tear," when he remembers
          our ARTEMUS WARD? Over the water now we have some yet; of
          whom we count "the TWAIN one;" and we can get up as good
          BILLINGS-gate as ever went to market. Then, for right
          Saxon wit, have we not SAXE himself? And, for the
          luminous, PETROLEUM, the ex-postmaster of the
          Cross-roads?</p>

          <p>"I represent a name, gentlemen, new with us, yet old
          in Europe. You are well aware that, in Italy"&mdash;</p>

          <p>"<i>That</i> might 'uv been tuk for granted; as the
          donkey said ven his dam called him a hass"&mdash;whispered,
          rather loudly, SAMIVEL, behind me.</p>

          <p>Now whether it was the Thames atmosphere that had got
          into my head, or whether it was SAM WELLER'S unexpected
          remark, I am unable, to this day, to say. But, somehow or
          other, my speech had, by this time, gone up. So I went
          down. If the speech was a rocket, I represented a stick.
          Perhaps JENKINS may yet wake up to the importance to the
          civilization of the century of reporting in full CHARLES
          DICKENS' speech, and BULWER'S, and the rest. If so, I
          will send them on. PUNCHINELLO, however, was honored as
          he deserves, at this dinner. Now for a little serious
          news.</p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">GREAT BRITAIN.</p>

          <p>JOHN SMITH, Esq., (son of the <i>elder</i> Smith,)
          finds it necessary to contradict the rumor that he is
          going to the United States. He is fearful lest there may,
          possibly, be another person of the same name in America;
          which might cause confusion.</p>

          <p>On dit that one of VICTORIA'S daughters was to be
          engaged to be married to a young member of the house of
          ORANGE. But it is believed now to have been a sour
          orange.</p>

          <p>Rev. Mr. MACKONOCHIE has been warned by the Bishop of
          London that he must reform his ritual, in some
          particulars. The Bishop is especially incensed at the
          censer; and waxes censorious about the wax lights. He
          insists that Father MACKONOCHIE must use Stearine or
          Spermaceti. Moreover, when water is mixed with wine, it
          must not come from the East River; and the wine must be
          red. Blue wine will do if he can find any.</p>

          <p>Church parties are much excited about Mr. MIALL'S
          Church-liberation scheme. But why so? Will not any Rev.
          who has a living, say, "Who takes my living takes away
          <i>my all!</i>" A bad pun; but a good argument. They
          should not <i>miaul</i> about it, at any rate.</p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">FRANCE.</p>

          <p>PIERRE BONAPARTE has gone to be king of the Feejee
          Islands. It has been stipulated that he shall not shoot
          more than one man in a month; and part of the tenderloin
          is to be given always to his Majesty's Prime
          Minister.</p>

          <p>M. GUERRONIER'S remark in the Senate, April 19th,
          requires explanation. He said that "Europe can be
          tranquil only when France is satisfied." He was alluding
          to the necessity of an early supply of copies of
          PUNCHINELLO; without which that excitable population can
          not be kept in a satisfactory state. I have made
          arrangements to have them forwarded accordingly.</p>

          <p>POTOCKIS, new Minister of Public Instruction, has
          offered his resignation. The reason is that a deputation
          of the professors and teachers called on him to say that
          it would take their pupils a year to learn how to spell
          his name. It is TSCHABUSHNIGG.&mdash;PRIME.</p><br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">POOR CAPTAIN
          EYRE.</span></p>

          <p>It is really outrageous to find fault with poor
          Captain EYRE. If ever a man had a full and perfect
          defence to the accusations which are made against him,
          EYRE is that man. Not content with offering one excuse,
          he offers a large and varied assortment of excuses, any
          one of which ought to be quite satisfactory. For example
          he asserts:</p>

          <p>That instead of running into the Oneida, the Oneida
          ran into him.</p>

          <p>That his ship struck the Oneida so lightly that he
          never knew there had been any collision.</p>

          <p>That he saw the Oneida just after he had run into her,
          and that she did not appear to have lost any thing but
          her skylights.</p>

          <p>That he stopped his engines and blew his whistle, in
          order to show that he was ready to offer any needed
          assistance to the Oneida.</p>

          <p>That the reason why he did not stop his engines and
          offer assistance, was that the collision had so injured
          his own ship that he thought best to make at once for the
          nearest port.</p>

          <p>That he never dreamed that any assistance was wanted,
          and therefore did not offer it.</p>

          <p>That he would have gone to the assistance of the
          Oneida had not one of his lady passengers been so
          frightened by the collision that she begged him to make
          all possible speed to land her.</p>

          <p>That not a single one of his passengers knew there had
          been a collision, so light was the shock of the
          contact.</p>

          <p>That it was only a Yankee ship, any how, and that it
          is all "blarsted" nonsense to make a fuss about it.</p>

          <p>Captain EYRE has returned to England, and asks, on the
          above grounds, that he be reinstated in command of his
          ship. It would be absurd to refuse so just a request. His
          defence could not well be more full unless he were to
          strengthen it with an alibi. If Mr. SOLOMON PELL still
          pursues the practice of the law, Captain EYRE should at
          once employ that eminent barrister to prove an alibi for
          him. His justification would then be too conclusive to
          admit of question.</p><br>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">CRITICISM OF THE
          PERIOD.</p>

          <p>[AFTER THE MANNER OF THE "NATION."]</p>

          <p><i>Milton's Paradise Lost.</i>&mdash;The demand for a new
          edition of this cumbrous piece of blank verse, proves
          what we have often said, that the want, in CROMWELLS
          time, of a literary journal of the character of the
          <i>Nation</i> has had a permanent effect upon literature.
          Had we been in existence when that obstinate and pedantic
          old Puritan wrote, we might have suppressed him. Still,
          there is no knowing what women and children will not
          read. While MILTON'S lines certainly measure generally
          about the same length, it is preposterous to call by the
          name of poetry what could be written in prose with so
          little modification. It is true that the same objection
          might be applied to HOMER and SHAKSPEARE. The former has
          the advantage of being written in Greek, so that very few
          people can read it. SHAKSPEARE has a popularity that is
          partly accounted for by the low taste of the people who
          have gone to the theatre to hear SIDDONS rave and GARRICK
          declaim, or who will persist in admiring MACREADY and
          BOOTH.</p>

          <p>As to MILTON, we have detected, with the aid of
          foot-notes to an old edition, a multitude of the most
          absolute plagiarisms from various authors. From the Bible
          mainly, and also from the Greek and Latin poets, he has
          taken nearly all his ideas; and every one of the words he
          uses are to be found in the dictionary. Talk of
          originality, after that! His conceptions also are
          sometimes absurd; for instance, the Address to Light. No
          one, who has not been stultified by theological
          nebulosities, ought to fail to know, as <i>we</i> knew
          when we first began to go to school, that a blind man
          cannot see anything at all. Therefore it is an insult to
          the understanding, and paltering with all the rational
          inductions of modern science, for an educated writer,
          stone blind, to say a word about light.</p>

          <p>In fact, the whole plot of the poem flies in the face
          of the cultivation of the Nineteenth Century. Such ideas
          as Paradise, Adam and Eve, and angels, are getting
          obsolete. While it is not to be expected that ordinary
          persons should have the intelligence or learning of the
          Editor and contributors of the <i>Nation</i>, we yet
          wonder that they are not always ready to abide by the
          instruction we are prepared to give them, at the small
          price of five dollars a year. Subscriptions received at

          (of whom we have never heard before) has invented a means
          of illuminating men's interiors. The doctor lives in
          Russia; and he takes you and throws inside of you "a
          concentrated beam of electric light;" and then he sees
          exactly what particular pill you want, and he gives it to
          you, and you go away (after paying him) exultant! This
          quite does away with the necessity of a bow-window in the
          bosom, so much desired by a certain ancient
          philosopher.</p>

          <p>Mr. PUNCHINELLO begs leave most respectfully to
          announce that he has determined to import, at any expense
          whatever, one of Dr. MILIO'S Concentrated Electric
          Beamers. With this Dr. PUNCHINELLO does not intend to
          engage in private practice. His purpose is to throw the
          light directly into the Body Politic, whether the B.P.
          requests him to do it or not. Dr. P. confidently expects
          to make some most extraordinary discoveries of various
          diseases&mdash;of greed, foolish ambition, ossification of the
          heart, moral leprosy, chronic stupidity, latent idiocy,
          and that very common and often unsuspected complaint
          usually known as Humbug. (<i>Humbugna Communis</i>.) His
          fee in no case will exceed ten cents per week; and
          patients WILL BE illuminated by the year.</p><br>

          <p>[IN WHICH THE YOUNG MEN OF THE PERIOD ARE TAKEN IN
          HAND.]</p>

          <p>Forty-four is going to talk (with a pen) to Fourteen.
          I am a female; and forty-four, as just hinted, is my age.
          Fourteen is also a female&mdash;just the age I was once. How I
          recollect that day! I was full of romance and hope; now
          I've no romance, little hope, and some wrinkles. It is a
          fine thing to be fourteen. I should like to go back
          there, and make a long visit. But that can't be. How much
          I wish it could! If only there were life-renewers as well
          as hair-renewers! They called me pretty at fourteen&mdash;said
          I had pretty ways, (one of them was one hundred and
          thirty-five avoirdupois,) and would certainly be a belle.
          But I proved too much for that. One hundred and
          seventy-five cut off all hope. I sighed, ate nothing,
          studied poetry, did a good deal of melancholy by
          moonlight and otherwise, but nothing came of it. I made
          myself as agreeable as possible; but it was the old
          story&mdash;I was too much for 'em&mdash;I mean the young men of
          the period. I dressed and gave parties. I took lessons in
          singing of Sig. Folderol, and in dancing of Mons.
          Pigeonwing, and could sing cavatinas and galop galops
          with the best of them. Ma said I was an angel, and Pa
          declared I was perfect. But none of the young men said
          so. My dear Fourteen, it may be just so with you. Your ma
          and pa may say you are angelic and perfect; but where's
          the use of it, if nobody else can be made to see it? I
          tried my best to catch the young men in my net. But,
          provoking things, they wouldn't be caught. Between
          ourselves&mdash;mind, don't blab it out&mdash;young men are the
          greatest noodles that were ever put upon the face of the
          earth. I never yet saw one that could be depended upon to
          stand by. I am sure, as you know, no one ever stood by
          me&mdash;when there was a parson at hand. At fourteen I didn't
          much care where they stood, if it wasn't on my corns.
          Twenty years later I shouldn't have been so particular.
          But I don't much mind now, bless you! You wont at
          forty-four. There's nothing to these young men. All talk,
          pretence, audacity, and paper collar, I assure you. I've
          studied all of them. They are the same now as then. Human
          nature, you know, my dear Fourteen, is the same
          yesterday, to-day, and week after next. I used to think
          it wasn't; now I know it is. These young men&mdash;monsters
          that they are&mdash;will pour the nectar of compliments over
          your face, and the acid and canker of abuse down your
          back; and all in the same breath, if they get a chance.
          Pray have an eye and an ear out for them. If you go to
          Long Branch, or Newport, or Saratoga, or the White
          Mountains this summer, just look out for them. They are
          dreadful creatures at home in the cities, but doubly
          dreadful at these resorts. You are young, simple,
          unsophisticated. I was at your age. But I soon got over
          such weaknesses. You must very soon, or be a ninny.
          "Simple," "artless," "unsophisticated," and such terms
          mean simply softness. Whatever else you are, or are not,
          don't be soft. The mistake of my fruitless life has been
          that I believed, in other years, all that was told me by
          the other sex. They said to my face that I was a beauty;
          at Mr. Jones's, they said I was a fright. They said I
          sang like a Patti; at Brown's, I screeched like an owl.
          They said I danced like Terpsichore; at Smith's, they
          declared I wabbled round like any other lame duck. They
          said my taste in dress was the pink of perfection; at the
          Duzenbury's, I was scandalously deficient in every thing
          of the sort. It's a way the young men of that day had
          with all the girls; and they go the same vile way now.
          Pray don't have any thing to do with them. I don't, and I
          wouldn't for the world. Folks say I'm prejudiced against
          em; but it isn't so&mdash;I hate 'em. It is healthy to hate
          what is hateful. It is healthy to hate a bundle of
          broadcloth, kerseymere, buttons, and brass, and it's my
          delight by day and dream by night. I'm forty-four&mdash;you're
          fourteen. I've seen the world&mdash;you haven't. You look
          through rosy glasses; I through the clear, naked eye. My
          advice to you on the young men question is this: Discount
          nine words in every ten spoken to you as absolute
          trash&mdash;the gush of mere evaporative sentiment. If you are
          called pretty, graceful, accomplished, neat in dress,
          comely in person, that your eyes sparkle like diamonds,
          and your lips are poetic, with whole volumes of such,
          just make up your mind that there are plenty of fools
          around trying to make a sillier one than themselves. It
          may seem very fine for the moment, but it will realize
          something very different afterward. Suppose you are not
          caught up? All the better. I'm forty-four, independent,
          free, a slave to no man nor monkey. Better live, to write
          your own tale than be the abject one to another. Better
          be forty-four and yourself, than a cipher belonging to
          some body else. Far better beware of the young men than
          be worn by them. At least so thinks and says</p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">A NEW RAILWAY PROJECT.</p>

          <p>While every one agrees that a railway running through
          the city of New-York, and transporting passengers with
          rapidity from one end of the island to the other, is an
          absolute necessity, no one has yet hit upon a plan which
          satisfies the public. The Society for the Prevention of
          Cruelty to Animals objects to the Elevated Road, on the
          ground (though it is in the air) that the cars will
          continually run off the track, and, falling on the horses
          and dogs in the street below, crush them to a fatal
          jelly. The Arcade plan is objectionable to the
          shop-keepers, inasmuch as it will change the great
          thoroughfare into a street consisting exclusively of
          cellars, thereby driving the buyers elsewhere.
          Conservative people, who like old things, naturally
          dislike the Pneumatic Railway, and vehemently assert that
          "they'll be blowed if they travel over it," which will
          undoubtedly prove to be true. Evidently a new plan must
          be devised if every body is to be satisfied. That plan
          PUNCHINELLO rather flatters himself that he has
          invented.</p>

          <p>It does not seem to have yet occurred to any one that
          we are not necessarily shut up to the single plan of
          fitting a railway to the city. Why can we not fit the
          city to the railway? Every body remembers that when the
          Mountain wouldn't come to MOHAMED, that eminent preacher
          went to the mountain. Here we have a precedent worth
          following, To build any sort of railway in New-York will
          take time and money. Why, then, should we do it when
          there are plenty of nice railways already built in every
          part of the country? There is a very nice railway
          completed and in running order from Pokertown, in Montana
          territory, to Euchrebend, just across the line in Idaho.
          All we have to do is to box up our buildings, together
          with the Central Park, the sewers, the docks, and the
          Tammany Hall General Committee, and express them through
          to Pokertown. The city can then be set up on each side of
          the Pokertown and Euchrebend Railway, and then we shall
          have the desired state of things&mdash;a railway running
          through the heart of our city. This plan is both novel
          and easy. At all events it is easy of execution in
          comparison with the Arcade plan, and it presents no
          features to which any one can reasonably object. Drawings
          of the city as it will appear when this plan has been
          carried out are now in process of publication, and will
          soon be for sale at this office. (N. B.&mdash;Shares in the

          <p>A "COUNTRYMAN" writes to us, asking whether the
          extension of "Murderer's Block" is among the current city
          improvements, He says that, on recently visiting this
          city, he had great difficulty in determining the exact
          locality of the sanctuary in question. Some said it was
          in the Eighth Ward; others located it in the Seventeenth.
          A policeman in East Houston street, in reply to the
          query, "Which is Murderer's Block?" waved his hand with a
          gesture indicative of unlimited space, and said, "You are
          on it." Not pleased with the impeaching tone of this
          reply, our informant made his way to another ward, where
          he put the same question to the first policeman who came
          along. Without giving him a direct reply, the officer
          winked, shifted his quid of tobacco so as to display his
          Check to full advantage, and pointed with his thumb over
          his shoulder at indefinite city "slums" behind him. Let
          the "Countryman" understand that, as things are at
          present, he may stand almost any where in the city and be
          within a marble-shot of "Murderer's Block." Perhaps
          Superintendent JOURDAN is quite aware of this.</p><br>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">NO GHOST AFTER ALL.</p>

          <p>MR. PUNCHINELLO, having been often scared out of his
          senses (which are usually very good and trustworthy
          senses,) by double tattoos on his library table, and also
          by the eccentric movements of the table itself, is happy
          to announce that, after all, there is nothing in it.
          There is a Dr. HAMMOND who has sent all necessary
          explanations to the <i>North American Review</i>. We do
          not understand them at all, but they are highly soothing
          and satisfactory. It seems that Mr. P. (in common with
          less distinguished characters) has "a gray tissue." This
          does not refer to his coat, but to something inside of
          him which renders him the nervous creature that he is.
          Well, not to make too scientific a matter of it, it
          appears that our "gray tissue" operates upon our "spinal
          cord," and raises the old boy (if we may be allowed the
          expression) with our brains; and this, in some way, but
          really we do not exactly see how, produces the raps, and
          leads us to suppose that we are hearing (dear old lady!)
          from our grandmother. It is astonishing how simple these
          mysterious matters appear after a scientific
          explanation.</p><br>

          <br>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">FISCALITIES.</p>

          <p>Let no one read this title&mdash;rascalities. Fiscalities
          are very different things. (<i>That is to say, out of
          Wall street.</i>) PUNCHINELLO always had a strong liking
          for fiscal subjects, and even now he would be glad to
          write a fiscal history of the United States, provided he
          was furnished with specimens of all the various coins,
          bank-notes, greenbacks, bonds, and such mediums of
          exchange that have been in circulation from colonial
          times until now. (<i>That is to say, he'd like very much
          to have the coins and things, but if any one takes up
          this offer, and wants to keep his coins, a money-order
          for a corresponding amount, or ordinary bills, in a
          registered letter, will be entirely satisfactory.</i>)
          But as he can not write a book this week, he desires to
          draw the attention of his readers to the fact that fiscal
          expansion ought to be the great end of man. (<i>That is
          to say, it often is, but in a different way from what
          PUNCHINELLO means.</i>) For instance, look at Colonel
          FISK, of the glorious Ninth! Had not his vigorous
          intellect been closely applied to the great questions of
          fiscal economy, is it likely that the steady expansion of
          his corporeal being would have given such a weight to his
          wisely-planned movements? (<i>That is to say, if he
          hadn't got rich he wouldn't have got so fat, and then
          buildings would not tremble when he drills.</i>) A man
          who is perfectly proportioned in a fiscal point of view,
          can call himself a monarch of the world. The elements
          will own they are his servants, and the seasons will
          mould themselves to suit his will. (<i>That is to say, he
          can have one hundred and fifty fine young women to dance
          the Devil's Torchlight Cotillion in his own theatre, and
          he can sit there, if he wants to, all alone and look at
          them just as long as he pleases; and not one of them dare
          stop till he's ready.</i>) Space bows before such a man,
          and shrivels itself up into a mere nothing. Land and
          water are alike to such a one. It matters not to him
          whether the waves roll beneath his possessions, or the
          solid ground upholds them.</p>

          <p>ST. CECILIA sits at the feet of this great exponent of
          fiscal expansion, and TUBAL CAIN dwells serenely in his
          court-yards. (<i>That is to say, just wait until you hear
          his new brass band!</i>) Now, who would not be as this
          financial monarch? Who would not say: "I, too, can do
          these things?" (<i>That is to say, which of us would not
          gladly take every cent the good FISK possesses, and let
          him beg his bread from door to door, if we only got a
          decent chance?</i>) If it were not for such shining
          examples of the power of wealth and the glories that it
          is capable of placing before our eyes, the souls of
          ordinary men would much less frequently be moved to
          extraordinary effort in the line of pecuniary progress.
          (<i>That is to say, if old FISK did not change the ballet
          in his Twelve Temptations so often, and did not keep on
          getting new dancers, and dressing them all up different
          every week or two, we would not have to raise a dollar
          and half so frequently to go and see the confounded
          thing.</i>) But it is of no use to try and calculate the
          vast advantage of Fiscal expansion. Even with a WEBB'S
          Adder, PUNCHINELLO could not do the sum, and it's pretty
          certain that it would make WEBB Sadder, if he tried it.
          Among other things, a man of fiscal solidity is never
          unprepared for emergencies, and, if necessary, he can
          resort to extremities of which ordinary people would
          never dream. (<i>That is to say, have you seen FISK'S
          last legs?</i>) Therefore, it becomes us all to endeavor
          to have a share in the prosperity of which we see such a
          shining example, (<i>that is to say, PUNCHINELLO does not
          mean for us all to go buy stock in Erie,</i>) and mayhap,
          even the humblest of us may, in time, be able to whistle
          "Shoo Fly" in marble halls. (<i>That is to say, even a
          poor ostler may get along very well if he attentively and
          industriously waters his stock.</i>)</p><br>

          <p>He wanted to annex the Winnipeg district. It was true
          that the Winnipeg district was an unmitigated nuisance to
          England; and probably it would prove an unmitigated
          nuisance to us if we annexed it. But it would make Great
          Britain mad. The dearest object of his life was to madden
          Great Britain. What was Great Britain? What business had
          she on this continent? None but the right of conquest. It
          occurred to him that that was all we had ourselves; but
          that made no difference. His motto was, Great Britain
          <span style="font-style: italic;">est</span> Carthago, or
          <span style="font-style: italic;">delenda</span> must be
          destroyed, or something of that sort&mdash;he forgot exactly
          what. He knew we could whip Great Britain, and he wanted
          to fight her. That is, he wanted some body else to fight
          her. It would be the proudest moment of his life to
          serve, exclusively as a sutler, in the grand American
          army which should go forth to smash Great Britain. Queen
          VICTORIA was only a woman. Therefore he would fight her
          single-handed. Let her come on. Let her son, who was a
          snob, come on. Let Mr. THORNTON come on. Let every body
          come on. He defied every body. He expectorated upon every
          body. (Mr. CHANDLER by this time became so earnest that
          seven Senators were constrained to wait upon him, but it
          produced no sedative effect.) Mr. CHANDLER kept on in
          this manner until he had challenged the population of the
          planet to single combat, and then subsided, and ordered
          five hundred copies of the morrow's <span style=
          "font-style: italic;">Globe</span> to send to various
          potentates and constituents.</p>

          <p>Mr. DRAKE said of course no body minded CHANDLER. But
          there were some glimmerings of sense in CHANDLER, and he
          thought the Winnipeg war would be a good thing. Perhaps
          CHANDLER might be induced to go out there, which would
          make it pleasant for the Senate. Mr. SUMNER said he was
          disgusted, not with CHANDLER'S principles, which were
          excellent, but with his quotation, which was incorrect.
          He considered correct quotation far more important than
          correct principles. Every school-boy knew that
          <span style="font-style: italic;">delenda est
          Carthago</span> was what Mr. CHANDLER attempted to cite.
          To be sure Mr. CHANDLER was not every school-boy. (Cheers
          for every School-boy.) Mr. SUMNER took advantage of this
          occasion to relate several incidents of the life of
          HANNIBAL, and closed with a protest against the accursed
          spirit of caste. In support of this view he sent to the
          clerk's desk, and had read a few chapters from KANT'S

          <p>Mr. BUTLER'S name was called. Mr. BUTLER was not
          there. Mr. SCHENCK proposed to fine him.</p>

          <p>Mr. COX objected. Why, he said, should the sweet boon
          of BUTLER'S absence rouse the anger of SCHENCK. He would
          suggest an amendment that BUTLER be fined when present
          and blessed when away. The less they had of BUTLER the
          better.</p>

          <p>Mr. AMES was making money, and therefore he could not
          come.</p>

          <p>Mr. DAVIS was prosecuting MCFARLAND, which he
          considered better fun than discussing the tariff.</p>

          <p>Mr. FITCH had gone to take a bath. Mr. LOGAN said that
          was ridiculous. He himself had never found it necessary
          to absent himself on such a ground. No representative of
          the people ought to take a bath.</p>

          <p>He was sorry to see this tendency to aristocracy on
          the part of members. West Point and the bath-tub were
          undermining our institutions.</p>

          <p>Mr. POLAND said that he had been to call on a
          clergyman. Mr. LOGAN said that was worse if possible than
          the bath. He much preferred immersion to sprinkling.</p>

          <p>Mr. SWEENEY (who is Mr. SWEENEY?) had been
          superintending the birth of an infant SWEENEY. Mr. KELLEY
          said a man who would basely look after his young when the
          fate of pig-iron was trembling in the balance, was
          unworthy to represent American freemen. What was the
          interesting situation of any individual, male or female,
          compared to the interesting situation of "fish-plates."
          The same fiendish spirit that animated the Confederate
          armies was still alive. But it now found expression in
          vile and insidious attacks upon the "scrap-iron" which
          was the pride of every true American heart. He did not
          hesitate to say that the man who would vote against an
          increase of 7000 per cent, <span style=
          "font-style: italic;">ad valorem</span>, upon railway
          iron would, if his cowardly soul would let him, have
          aimed the pistol of the assassin at the late Mr.
          LINCOLN.</p>

          <p>Mr. LOGAN said there was no occasion for Mr. KELLEY to
          say any thing about any man from Illinois. He, LOGAN,
          could take care of that State without KELLEY'S
          assistance. He had observed with grief and shame that
          KELLEY had made several more speeches this session than
          he (LOGAN) had. He did not intend to suffer this in
          future.</p>

          <p>Mr. KELLEY said he voted for his constituents, who
          were ironmongers; but ho spoke, in an iron-ical way, for
          the whole country. He meant to speak early and speak
          often.</p>

          <p>Mr. SCHENCK upheld the income-tax. He said it bore
          very lightly on Congressmen, for none but honest men were
          compelled to pay it.</p><br>

          <p><b>OUR LITERARY LEGATE.</b></p>

          <p>Minister MOTLEY is a gentleman, a scholar, and, though
          last not least, as genial a diner and winer as ever put
          American legs under a British peer's mahogany. There was
          a time when he was for avenging British outrage by
          whipping John Bull out of his boots, but now, clad in a
          dress-coat of unexceptionable cut, he deprecates the idea
          of international breaches. As a diplomatist he could
          scarcely show more indifference to the Alabama claim, if
          the claim itself were All a Bam. He roars for recompense
          more gently than a sucking dove. When he presented our
          little bill a <span style="font-style: italic;">grand
          coup</span> was expected, but the trans-atlantic turtle
          seems to have shut him up. Listening to compliments on
          the "Dutch Republic" he forgets his own, and renders but
          a Flemish account to his country. Not content with
          following the festive footsteps of his illustrious
          predecessor, REVERDY, he has made new tracks to every
          hospitable nobleman's door. The scented soft-soap of
          adulation is his "particular vanity," and under its
          soothing influence he seems to be washing his hands of
          his official responsibilities. In point of fact, MOTLEY
          has deserted his colors, and, as a diplomat, is by no
          means up to the American Standard. As it is clear he
          cannot maintain the <i>prestige</i> of the Star Spangled
          Banner abroad, we call upon the Government to give him
          Hail Columbia, and order him home.</p><br>

          <p>IN SPAIN AND A VISIT TO PORTUGAL. By HANS CHRISTIAN
          ANDERSEN. New-York: HURD &amp; HOUGHTON.</p>

          <p>A good summer book of nearly three hundred pages. As
          usual, ANDERSEN is not abstruse in his way of putting
          things. His narrative is adapted alike for the juvenile
          mind and for the adult. There is no periphrasis in it.
          One understands his meaning at a glance; therefore the
          book should be a very popular one when summer time sets
          in, and people look for some quiet
          <i>d&eacute;lassement</i> which will not compel them to
          think.</p><br>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
